# Blog Post - Debugging Webpack for Beginner Contributors

Blog post aimed for beginner Webpack contributors. Typically we as developers tend to debug a codebase as a means to understand how all things work under the hood. As we step through the codebase, we slowly start to understand how all the different modules come together when an input is provided.

Here I try to explain how to debug Webpack agains't a sample project.
